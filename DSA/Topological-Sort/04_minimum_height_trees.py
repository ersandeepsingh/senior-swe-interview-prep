# Minimum Height Trees
#
# LeetCode: 310
# Difficulty: Medium
# Pattern: Layered removal (BFS/Kahn)
#
# Problem:
# A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.
# In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
#
# Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where
# edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes
# a_i and b_i in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select
# a node x as the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees,
# those with minimum height (i.e. min(h)) are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
#
# Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
# Output: [1]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 6, edges = [[3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 4], [5, 4]]
# Output: [3, 4]
#
# Constraints:
# - 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
# - edges.length == n - 1
# - 0 <= a_i, b_i < n
# - a_i != b_i
# - All the pairs (a_i, b_i) are unique
# - The given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated edges
